### Key drivers for moving to Cloud

1. **Scalability**: Cloud services allow businesses to scale up or down quickly and easily to meet changing business needs. This flexibility is particularly useful for businesses with fluctuating workloads or seasonal demands.
2. **Cost savings**: Cloud services can often provide cost savings compared to on-premises infrastructure, as businesses only pay for the resources they use through pay-as-you-go model, rather than investing in expensive hardware and maintenance costs.
3. **Increased efficiency and productivity**: Cloud services provide businesses with access to the latest technologies, allowing them to work faster and more efficiently. This can lead to increased productivity and a more agile business model.
4. **Improved security**: Cloud service providers often have robust security measures in place to protect data and infrastructure.
5. **Disaster recovery and reliability**: Cloud services can provide businesses with disaster recovery and business continuity solutions, allowing them to quickly recover from a disaster or outage and continue operating without interruption.

### Cloud Infrastructure

- Cloud Infrastructure includes hardware, software such as servers, storage, networking and virtualization softwares that are essential for a cloud computing model.

- This infrastructure is typically owned and managed by a cloud service provider and allows users to access computing resources and storage on a pay-per-use basis.

- #### Regions

  - Cloud infrastructure is organized into different geographic **regions**, each of which contains one or more data centers that are physically located in a specific region of the world. 
  - These regions are designed to provide users with low latency, high availability, and fault tolerance, as well as compliance with local data protection and privacy regulations.

- #### Computing resources

  - Within each region, cloud infrastructure typically includes a range of **computing resources**, such as *virtual machines, containers, and serverless computing services*, that can be used to run applications and workloads. 
  - These resources can be scaled up or down as needed to meet changing demands, and users are typically only charged for the resources they use.

- #### Storage components

  - Cloud infrastructure also includes storage components, such as object storage and block storage, that can be used to store data and files. 
  - These storage components are typically highly scalable and durable, with built-in redundancy to ensure data is always available.

### Virtualization

- Virtualization is the process of creating something abstractly other than the actual version of that. It refers to the creation of different computer resources virtually such as a server, a storage device, an operating system or network resources.
- Types of Virtualization: Hardware Virtualization, Operating system Virtualization, Server Virtualization, Storage Virtualization.

### Virtualization in Cloud

- Virtualization is a technology that enables the creation of multiple virtual machines (VMs) that run on a single physical server. In cloud computing, virtualization is used to create virtual instances of computing resources such as servers, storage, and networks.
- The use of virtualization in cloud computing enables the creation of virtual resources that are independent of the underlying hardware. 
- This means that users can access these virtual resources from anywhere, at any time, using any device that has an internet connection.
- A *virtual machine* is a software-defined computer that runs on a physical computer with a separate operating system and computing resources. The physical computer is called the *host machine* and virtual machines are *guest machines*.

### How virtualization in Cloud works

1. **Hypervisor**: The first step in virtualization is the installation of a hypervisor or virtual machine manager (VMM) on the physical server. The hypervisor is a software layer that enables the creation and management of virtual machines on the server. It ensures that each virtual machine gets the allocated resources and does not interfere with the operation of other virtual machines.
2. **Virtual Machines:** Once the hypervisor is installed, virtual machines can be created. Each virtual machine is a software emulation of a physical computer, complete with its own operating system, applications, and virtualized hardware.
3. **Virtual Networks**: Virtual networks can also be created using virtualization technology. These networks allow virtual machines to communicate with each other and with the outside world.
4. **Resource Allocation**: The hypervisor manages the allocation of computing resources such as CPU, memory, and storage to each virtual machine. This ensures that each virtual machine has access to the resources it needs to run its applications.
5. **Management**: Virtual machines can be managed using a management console, which enables administrators to monitor and manage the virtual environment. This includes tasks such as creating and deleting virtual machines, allocating resources, and configuring virtual networks.
