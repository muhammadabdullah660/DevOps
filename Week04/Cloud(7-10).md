### Cloud-native applications

Cloud-native applications are software applications that are designed and developed to run natively on cloud infrastructure. They are built using cloud-native technologies, architectures, and methodologies that enable them to take full advantage of the scalability, flexibility, and resilience of cloud computing environments.

Cloud-native applications are typically developed using containerization technology such as Docker and Kubernetes. They are also built using microservices architecture, which involves breaking down the application into smaller, loosely-coupled components that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

Other key characteristics of cloud-native applications include:

- Automatic scaling: The application can scale up or down automatically based on demand.
- Resilience: The application is designed to be fault-tolerant, so it can continue to operate even if one or more components fail.
- Agility: Cloud-native applications are built to be agile and responsive to changing business requirements.
- DevOps culture: They are developed using a DevOps culture, where developers and operations teams work closely together to streamline the development, deployment, and management of the application.
