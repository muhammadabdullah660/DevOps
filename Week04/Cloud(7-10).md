### Cloud-native applications

Cloud-native applications are software applications that are designed and developed to run natively on cloud infrastructure. They are built using cloud-native technologies, architectures, and methodologies that enable them to take full advantage of the scalability, flexibility, and resilience of cloud computing environments.

Cloud-native applications are typically developed using containerization technology such as Docker and Kubernetes. They are also built using microservices architecture, which involves breaking down the application into smaller, loosely-coupled components that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

Other key characteristics of cloud-native applications include:

- Automatic scaling: The application can scale up or down automatically based on demand.
- Resilience: The application is designed to be fault-tolerant, so it can continue to operate even if one or more components fail.
- Agility: Cloud-native applications are built to be agile and responsive to changing business requirements.
- DevOps culture: They are developed using a DevOps culture, where developers and operations teams work closely together to streamline the development, deployment, and management of the application.

### How does DevOps work on cloud?

When combined, DevOps and cloud computing can improve software delivery by providing developers with access to the infrastructure and tools needed to deploy, test, and monitor their applications.

Here are some ways in which DevOps works on cloud:

1. Infrastructure as Code (IaC): DevOps teams can use IaC tools like Terraform or CloudFormation to automate the process of creating and configuring cloud infrastructure. This allows teams to provision infrastructure resources on-demand and eliminates the need for manual configuration.
2. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): DevOps teams can use cloud-based CI/CD tools like Jenkins or TravisCI to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying applications. These tools can also help with version control and collaboration.
3. Microservices Architecture: DevOps teams can leverage cloud-native architectures like microservices to create scalable and resilient applications. Microservices are small, independent services that can be deployed and scaled independently, which makes it easier to manage complex applications.
4. Monitoring and Analytics: DevOps teams can use cloud-based monitoring and analytics tools like CloudWatch or Datadog to monitor the performance of their applications and infrastructure. This helps teams identify and resolve issues quickly.

Overall, DevOps and cloud computing can work together to improve the speed and reliability of software delivery. By automating processes and leveraging cloud-based infrastructure and tools, DevOps teams can focus on delivering high-quality applications faster and more efficiently.
