### DevOps Behaviors

*Dev wants innovation, while Ops want stability*

- In traditional Ops, the teams are always on a bit conflict.
- DevOps is a collaborative culture that emphasizes communication, collaboration, and integration between development and operations teams. 
- In order to successfully implement DevOps practices, there are several behaviors that are important for team members to exhibit.
  1. **Continuous improvement**: DevOps requires a mindset of continuous improvement, where team members are always looking for ways to optimize their processes and workflows.
  2. **Collaboration**: Collaboration is a key part of DevOps, and team members should be willing to work together to achieve common goals.
  3. **Automation**: Automation is a core part of DevOps, and team members should be willing to embrace automation tools to streamline their workflows and reduce errors.
  4. **Experimentation**: DevOps teams should be willing to experiment with new tools, processes, and workflows to find the best solutions for their projects.
  5. **Ownership**: Team members should take ownership of their work and be accountable for their actions and decisions.
  6. **Communication**: Effective communication is critical to the success of DevOps, and team members should be able to communicate clearly and effectively with each other.
  7. **Continuous learning**: DevOps requires a culture of continuous learning, where team members are always seeking to improve their skills and knowledge.

### Site Reliability Engineering

*Started from Google in 2003 and further adopted by many companies.*

Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is a set of principles and practices that focus on ensuring the **reliability**, **availability**, and performance of software systems. SRE is a specific implementation of DevOps that was developed by Google, and it has since been adopted by many other organizations. SRE can also reduce friction between Dev teams that always want continuous releases and Ops teams that don't want to release any type of update or new software without being absolutely sure it won't cause outages or other operations problems.

SRE is “what happens when you ask a software engineer to design an operations function". - *Google’s VP of Engineering, Ben Treynor*.

SRE simply automate IT operations such as monitoring and managing system performance using software tools. The purpose is to make large-scale applications more reliable and scalable.

### Role of Site Reliability Engineers

A site reliability engineer is a software developer with IT operations experience— someone who knows how to code, and who also understands how to keep the system working in a large-scale IT environment.

- Site reliability engineers spend half their time performing manual IT operations and system administration tasks—analyzing logs, performance tuning, applying patches, testing production environments, responding to incidents, conducting postmortems—and spend the rest of their time developing code that automates those tasks.
- The SRE team serves as a bridge between development teams and operations teams.
- SREs work closely with development teams to ensure that software systems are designed with reliability in mind, and they use automation and monitoring tools to ensure that these systems are highly available.

### SRE Vs DevOps
